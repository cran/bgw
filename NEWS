THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "bgw" PACKAGE

Note that this approach to documenting changes could be changed, depending
on advice or input from CRAN or others


     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.1 (2023-04-3)

* The original version did not include options for scaling. (A scale vector
  of 1's was the hard-wired option.) This version allows for two scaling
  options: "adaptive" and "none".  (The later corresponds to using a vector
  1's.)  The default is "adaptive," which is the original default in the
  Fortran version.  For additional information, see the documentation for
  "bgw_mle."
