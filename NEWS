THIS IS THE CHANGELOG OF THE "bgw" PACKAGE

Note that this approach to documenting changes could be changed, depending
on advice or input from CRAN or others

    CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.4 (2026-02-03)

  * [1] An option was added to bgw_settings to allow the user to request that
  individual-level gradients at the final value of beta be returned with the
  model. The default is FALSE.

  * [2] Some of the items in the bgw_message_table were modified by
  appending the terms '(favorable)' or '(unfavorable)' to clarify for the user
  the nature of the outcome of the search. For example, 'Relative function
  convergence' is a favorable outcome, and 'Singular convergence' is an
  unfavorable outcome.

    CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.3 (2024-03-27)

  * [1] CRAN Package Check produced errors for two Linux OS's (apparently due to
  changes in Fortran compilers).  CRAN Team and Prof. Brian Ripley provided
  clarification and advice on the issues via email (
  via email (18 March, 2024).  We made multiple changes to address the list of
  issues they describe. Whether these suffice awaits repeating the checks at
  CRAN (since I do not use these Linux platforms).

* [2] Minor changes and bug fixes were made to bgw_mle.R. These changes ensure
  that 'silent mode' performs properly.  Other changes fix a bug that was
  preventing the use of the option bgw_settings[["scalingMethod"]] = "none".

     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.2 (2023-07-10)

* Two main changes in this version are due to (1) a change in CRAN fortran
  requirements, and (2) the need to add an option for user-provided scaling.

* [1] A change in CRAN requirements was communicated from Prof. Brian Ripley
  via email (19 June, 2023), which disallows the use of GNU language extensions.
  The test is based on including the compiler option --std=f2008.  Specifically, the
  function "isnan" is regarded as a gfortran extension relative to this
  standard.  Suggestions were to use an old approach (that we originally were
  using), or to choose something that satisfies the f2003 standard. We have elected
  to include the ieee arithmetic module and use the function ieee_is_nan(x).
  If this does not meet the requirement, we will need to make changes and resubmit.

* [2] The option for user-provided scaling has been added, so the options are
  now: "adaptive", "none", and "userScaling", where the default is
  "adaptive". For the user to execute this successfully, they must
  modify two elements of bgw_settings:
    bgw_settings["scalingMethod"] must be set to "userScaling", and
    bgw_settings["userScaleVector"] must be set to a correctly specified scaling vector.
  For additional information, see the documentation for
  "bgw_mle."


     CHANGES IN VERSION 0.1.1 (2023-04-3)

* The original version did not include options for scaling. (A scale vector
  of 1's was the hard-wired option.) This version allows for two scaling
  options: "adaptive" and "none".  (The later corresponds to using a vector
  1's.)  The default is "adaptive," which is the original default in the
  Fortran version.  For additional information, see the documentation for
  "bgw_mle."
